Food Image Classification

This repository contains code for a food classification problem using a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) model. The goal is to classify images of food into different categories.

Project Overview
In this project, we develop a convolutional neural network from scratch to classify food images. The model is trained and evaluated on a dataset of food images, and the performance is measured using standard metrics.

Contents
Food_image_Classification.ipynb: The Jupyter notebook containing the entire code for data preprocessing, model architecture, training, and evaluation.
Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you need the following packages:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using pip:
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn

Usage
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/food-image-classification.git
Navigate to the project directory:

cd food-image-classification
Open the Jupyter notebook:

jupyter notebook Food_image_Classification.ipynb

Run the cells in the notebook to preprocess the data, build the model, train it, and evaluate its performance.
Model Architecture
The custom convolutional neural network consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, and finally fully connected layers. The architecture is designed to capture the hierarchical features of the food images and make accurate predictions.

Results
The model is evaluated on a test set, and its performance is reported using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
